# DELTOR---Delivery-Hubs-Locator

## DESCRIPTION

There is a city with some sub-cities in it. The city is represented as a graph, and the position of each sub-city is identified with it's coordinates(x,y). There are no two sub-cities in the same position. It is not necessary that all sub-cities are linked to each other. The distance between two sub-cities is the distance formula for distance between 2 points in a coordinate axis.

There is an organization which sells products. The company wants to setup its multiple delivery hubs in a city. A sub-city and delivery hub in it it(if assigned to it) will have same coordinates. 

The above task depends upon DISTANCE factor and POPULATION Factor. The Population factor has been handled by the organization itself and they have found the cities in which placing delivery hubs will benefit them maximum. They now just need to deal with the distance factor.    

For setting up delivery hubs, their positions should be chosen so that the average distance from each sub-city to its delivery hub is minimized.

### CONSTRAINTS

*	No. of Delivery Hubs <= No. of sub-cities.
*	There should be ATLEAST 2 sub-cities which are linked with only 1 sub-city.

### INPUT

Given the positions of the sub-cities, roads and the number of delivery hubs to be set-up, compute the positions/sub/cities where the hubs should be installed so that the average distance from each sub-city to its nearest delivery hub  is minimized for the entire city.
